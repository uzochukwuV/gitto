Overview
On Solana, sending a transaction is only one small part of the story.

There are different lifecycles in the network before a transaction lands; leader scheduling, TPU ingestion, block production, shred propagation, and multiple commitment stages. Production systems need to understand this entire flow, react to failures correctly, and make smart decisions under changing network conditions.

This bounty focuses on building a real transaction infrastructure stack powered by:

Jito bundles

Live Yellowstone/Geyser streaming

Transaction lifecycle tracking

AI-assisted decision making

You will build a smart transaction stack that observes the network in real time, submits transactions intelligently, tracks outcomes across commitment levels, and uses an AI agent to make one meaningful operational decision autonomously.

This is an infrastructure-heavy challenge designed for developers who want to go deeper into how Solana transactions actually move through the network.

Requirements
1. Architecture Design Document
Your submission must include a public architecture document hosted separately from your GitHub repository.

Accepted formats:

Figma

Notion

Google Docs

Any public URL

Your document should explain:

The system architecture

Key components

Data flow between services

Infrastructure decisions

Failure handling strategy

AI agent responsibilities

Diagrams are strongly encouraged.

This document will be judged separately, so clarity and depth matter.

2. The Transaction Stack
Build a working smart transaction stack that can:

Monitor live slot and leader data using:

Yellowstone gRPC

Or any compatible Geyser stream provider

Detect the correct leader window for submission

Construct and submit Jito bundles

Calculate bundle tips dynamically using:

Real recent tip account data

Current network conditions

No hardcoded tip values

Track transaction lifecycle stages:

Submitted

Processed

Confirmed

Finalized

Capture:

Timestamps

Slot numbers

Latency deltas between stages

Detect and classify failures:

Expired blockhash

Fee too low

Compute exceeded

Bundle failure

Confirm landing using stream subscriptions

RPC polling alone is not sufficient

Handle retries automatically

Including blockhash refresh on expiry

3. Lifecycle Log
Your submission must include a lifecycle log from at least:

10 real bundle submissions

Including at least 2 failure cases

Each log entry should contain:

Slot numbers

Commitment progression

Timestamps

Tip amounts

Failure classification (if applicable)

Judges will cross-reference slot numbers using Solana explorers to verify that your stack ran on real infrastructure.

4. AI Agent Demonstration
You must build an AI agent that owns one real operational decision inside your stack.

Choose one of the following:

Failure Reasoning
The agent:

Observes failed transactions

Reasons about why they failed

Decides what should change before retrying

Retry decisions must come from the agent itself, not hardcoded logic.

Tip Intelligence
The agent:

Analyzes recent tip account data

Monitors current slot conditions

Decides how much to tip for each bundle

The reasoning process should balance:

Cost

Landing probability

Submission Timing
The agent:

Watches slot streams and leader schedules

Decides when to submit

Holds transactions when conditions are unfavorable

Autonomous Retry with Fault Injection
Your stack must:

Simulate at least one blockhash expiry failure

The agent must:

Detect the failure

Reason about the cause

Refresh the blockhash

Recalculate the tip

Resubmit autonomously

No hardcoded retry flow allowed.

The AI agent must make real decisions.

A simple wrapper that calls functions sequentially without reasoning will not qualify.

5. README Questions
We want submissions that show real operational understanding, not just working code.

Your README should explain the observations, tradeoffs, and lessons from your running system. Strong submissions will clearly show that the builder understands how Solana transactions behave under real network conditions.

Your README must answer these three questions:

Question 1
What does the delta between processed_at and confirmed_at tell you about network health at the time of submission?

Question 2
Why should you never use finalized commitment when fetching a blockhash for a time-sensitive transaction?

Question 3
What happens to your bundle if the Jito leader skips their slot?

These questions have specific correct answers. Responses based on real observations from your running infrastructure will score highest.

6. General Requirements
Your submission must include:

Open-source code

Clear setup instructions

Working prototype on:

Devnet

Or mainnet

You may build:

Solo

Or with a team

Technical Expectations
Your project should demonstrate:

Correct slot streaming implementation

Proper reconnection and backpressure handling

Real Jito bundle construction

Dynamic tip logic from live data

Proper use of commitment levels

Clean separation between:

AI layer

Core transaction stack

Failure handling is required.

Happy-path-only submissions will not score well.

Judging Criteria
Does It Work?
Functional stack

Real lifecycle logs

Successful and failed submissions demonstrated

Evidence of real operational understanding

Observations from actual system behavior

Prizes
